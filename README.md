ZenithCompiler is an evolving compiler project, currently functioning as a basic interpreter for mathematical and boolean expressions. The project is in its early stages and is continuously being developed to become a full-fledged compiler in the future.

## ✨ Current Features
- Interpretation of mathematical expressions (e.g. `(2 * 4) / (2.6 - 1)`)
- Support for variable assignments (e.g. `a = 10; coolVar = true`)
- Interpretation of boolean expressions (e.g. `!false && (false || coolBar)`)

## 🛠 Planned Features
- Control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals) 🔁
- Functions and procedures 📋
- Compilation to machine code or bytecode 💽

## 🔧 Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dm432/ZenithCompiler.git`
2. Navigate into the project folder and run the interpreter with the following command: `./gradlew run -q --console=plain`
